# Planck 
### A small framework for RESTful PHP apps
An experiment in writing a [small] RESTful framework for PHP. Makes use of the [Burlap](https://www.github.com/codeeverything/burlap) container for dependencies.

Named for the Planck time and length - the smallest measurements of time and length, respectively, that have any meaning.

NB: This is an ongoing project in its infancy, so expect much to be missing and much not to work ;)

## Open Source

This is an open source effort, and although its only a pet project of mine contributions are welcome! So fork and PR away :)

Feel free to add issues to leave suggestions and comments.
